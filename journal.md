What i think about the cell phone law is that its dumb because what if something bad happenes and no one has there phone to contact anyone or the police. The cell phone law also makes school boring because you cant be on it when u have free time or at lunch. The phone law is also doesnt allow students to contact parents if they arent feeling good. Phones make students feel safe. School is boring without phones
