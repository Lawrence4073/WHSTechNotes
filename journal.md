What i think about the cell phone law is that its dumb because what if something bad happenes and no one has there phone to contact anyone or the police. The cell phone law also makes school boring because you cant be on it when u have free time or at lunch. The phone law is also doesnt allow students to contact parents if they arent feeling good.

## Prompt
Make me a short education quiz game about math for students in highschool
## Reflection
 I've created an interactive math quiz with 5 high school level questions covering algebra, geometry, and functions. The quiz features a progress bar, instant feedback with explanations, and a final score with encouraging messages. This game helps highschool students practice more, and helps them learn more where ever they are. This game helps students in class and gets them to know more for the future. The game works for any grade in highschool.
